## LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH APACHE


After completing Project-7 you might wonder how a user will be accessing each of the webservers using 3 different IP addresses or 3 different DNS names. You might also wonder what is the point of having 3 different servers doing exactly the same thing.
When we access a website in the Internet we use an URL and we do not really know how many servers are out there serving our requests, this complexity is hidden from a regular user, but in the case of websites that are being visited by millions of users per day (like Google or Reddit), it is impossible to serve all the users from a single Web Server (it is also applicable to databases, but for now we will not focus on distributed DBs).
