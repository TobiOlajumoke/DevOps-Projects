## ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)


In this project you will continue working with ansible-config-mgt repository and make some improvements of your code. Now you need to refactor your Ansible code, create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it allows you to organize your tasks and reuse them when needed.
Side Self Study: For better understanding or Ansible artifacts re-use – read this [article.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse.html)


## Code Refactoring
Refactoring is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing expected behaviour of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, add proper comments without affecting the logic.
In your case, you will move things around a little bit in the code, but the overal state of the infrastructure remains the same.

Let us see how you can improve your Ansible code!



## Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement

Before we begin, let us make some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. Let us enhance it by introducing a new Jenkins project/job – we will require Copy Artifact plugin.
